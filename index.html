                         <h2>A brief look into Nuclear Weapons </h2>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <h3>A foreword:</h3>
                        <p>While this may appear a strange choice to talk about on a website, I wrote my dissertation on British Nuclear Weapons and thus have a lot of knowledge of which I can talk about!</p>
                        <h4>Information:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Britain first acquired deliverable Nuclear Weapons in 1955 through the V-bomber, allowing the nation to reach targets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. However, this was not a sustainable or secure way to ensure Britain had a credible nuclear deterrent. This was due to the fear of a first-strike approach from the USSR, as Britain’s runways and thus means to respond to a nuclear attack could be destroyed should the USSR decide to act first with overwhelming power. Therefore Britain decided to upgrade its vulnerable aircraft into missiles, initially deciding to build its own – the ‘blue streak’ missile.
                            </p>

                        <p>Blue Streak however proved to be very challenging to create without the financial resources of the United States. Britain therefore sought to purchase missiles from the US, deciding on the air launched Skybolt missile. This was however an unfortunate decision; the Kennedy administration unexpectedly cancelled the project, leading to a meeting in Nassau in 1962 which ultimately cumulated in Britain obtaining state of the art submarine launched ballistic missiles, for a very favourable price. Britain was to build its own submarines and lease the missiles from the US, allowing it to save on maintenance costs of the missiles and not having to expend valuable resources on the development of the missiles. My dissertation focused on the nuclear delivery systems available to Britain (three different missiles – Polaris, Chevaline, and Trident) and how they affected foreign policy.  I found the most striking results with Polaris, likely as it represented the greatest shift in delivery technology because it was shifting from vulnerable planes to (more or less) invulnerable submarines which would ensure a second-strike capability.

                        <h3>My unqualified views on Abbey Road</h3>
                        <p>Abbey Road was the final album recording by the Beatles. Released and recorded in 1969 this album marked a return to the typical studio style of the Beatles, in a similar manner to Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, as subsequent albums had followed different recording styles, such as the White Album where the band rarely recorded as one and adopted a less polished sound, and what would become Let it Be, where the majority of the songs were recorded live as a band and without overdubs. This album would come to be released after Abbey Road but the material was recorded before, mostly in January 1969. Abbey Road features some of the band’s most popular songs; Come Together, Something, and perhaps most famously, Here Comes the Sun. The latter song in particular is known to billions around the world and has surpassed one billion streams on Spotify alone. But for me, as this is all my opinion and various pieces of (somewhat useless) knowledge I have absorbed, the greatest part of the album is the medley on the second side of the album, featuring many songs which gracefully lead towards the final song recorded by the group, and the final song on the album; the poignant and appropriately named ‘The End’.</p>
