                            Liv and Lucy we could go for a drive <br>
                            Liv and Lucy we could get really high <br>
                            It’d be fun <br>
                            Under the sun <br>
                            Let’s have some drinks together <br>

                            <br>
                            The crisps would be <br>
                            shaped like shells on a beach <br>
                            Let’s go to Brighton where we’ll
                            Find something to eat <br>

                                Maybe one day we’ll think about our lives <br>
                                And how they’ve changed since we left paradise <br>         
                                Though reading wasn’t pretty on the outside, it’s people made it shine <br>
                                <br>
                                You became so important to me <br>
                                You opened my eyes and allowed me to see <br>
                                Uni became somewhere I wanted to be, all because of you <br>
                                <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my year, I only wish that you were here <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my day, why are you so far away? <br>
                                <br>
                                I’m not sure how our lives will change <br>
                                Now they’re no longer so arranged <br>
                                Once we don’t have to talk to one another, do you want to still? <br>
                                <br>
                                I look forward to the final night <br>
                                Maybe your man and I will have a fight <br>
                                I’m not violent but for you I might, you have changed my life <br>
                                <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my year, I only wish that you were here <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my day, why are you so far away? <br>
                                <br> (Bridge!) <br>
                                All these nights I’ve been meaning to say, while you have been so far away <br>
                                Oh Livvy I love you so, do you feel that way about me though <br>
                                <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my year, I only wish that you were here <br>
                                Liv and Lucy you made my day, why are you so far away? <br>
                                <br>
                                Maybe one day we’ll think about our lives <br>

                                Well I walked into the room and I looked at the moon
                                And I thought oh my god the sky <br>
                                So I said stop little girl you need to look at the world
                                and you might have to open your eyes <br>
                                Because the moon was so bright it was truly a sight <br>  
                                And it made me feel simply sublime <br>
                                But the light was too bright and I couldn’t see right <br> so I asked her to turn out the light <br>
                                <br>

                                Turn out the light, <br> turn out the light, <br> turn out the light, <br>
                                She said she might
                                <br><br>
                                When I left the small room I saw the faces look
                                Everybody wanted to see <br>
                                What kind of a man would be oh so damned
                                to ask a kid to help him <br>
                                I got scared and turned and ran but that small madman
                                just wanted a piece of me <br>
                                So he stood in my way and said oh hey <br>
                                Somebody go turn out the light <br>

                                <br>Turn out the light, <br> turn out the light, <br>turn out the light,
                                Oh damn he’ll fight <br> <br>

                                As soon as I turned and ran towards my friend dan he pointed me towards Lucy, <br> she said oh Dan this is a true man I want to be fruity <br>
                                Please get us a room and maybe me a frube I just want to cool down right now <br>
                                And when you come back will you make the room black please just turn out the lights 
                                <br> <br>
                                Chorus <br> <br>

                                Well I walked into the room and I looked at the moon
                                And I thought oh my god the sky <br>
                                But the light was too bright to see the moon right
                                So I said don’t worry it’s fine <br>
                                Because the moon was so bright it would truly be a sight
                                and it could make me feel simply sublime <br>
                                But the light was too bright and I couldn’t see right so I told her to keep on the light


                                <br> <br> Keep on the light, <br> Keep on the light, <br>keep on the light <br>
                                I said goodbye 
                                <br>

                                Well although our love has passed, I’m sailing half mast <br>

                                We will be fine if our love will shine <br>
                                We can work it out
                                <br> <br>
                                Ever since you went away I’ve been trying to find a way to see your face again <br>
                                Oh I find you beautiful and you’re ever so wonderful but you don’t care for me
